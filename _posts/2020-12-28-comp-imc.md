We participated in the [International Micromouse Challenge](https://techfest.org/competitions/micromouse) at TechFest, IIT Bombay 2020-2021. And we got the first position!

The objective was to design an autonomous bot on ROS (simulated on Gazebo) which reaches from the corner square to the center of an unknown maze in the shortest time.

I was fortunate to be leading an epic team. Shubham Agrawal ideated and added the omniwheel design to the robot. Tejal Barnwal implemented a PD controller and took care of goal-to-goal navigation supplemented by the swiftness of omniwheel drive. I was in-charge of designing all algorithms to break down and conquer the problem statement. In this article, I will touch upon my work.

Our implementation in action can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/PcbNQ-tVwQw).

### Breaking down the problem
The problem was in two parts:
- Incrementally building a faithful representation of the maze walls and free space
- Minimizing the exploration phase to quickly find the optimal path to reach the maze center

#### Part 1: Maze Representation
The first part was an exercise in concentration. There were several details adding to the complexity:
- multiple reference frames attached to the world, the mobile robot, and our maze representation
- odometry and laser scan data were in continuous position coordinates
- conversion from the continuous position coordinates to discrete entries in our maze representation

After solving these, we dealt with the problem of noisy laser data. This had a crafty solution. We maintained a confidence matrix --- if the same wall was seen above a threshold number of times, it would be added in the maze representation.

#### Part 2: Path Search and Planning
We devised a solution for dealing with lack of knowledge of the full maze in the exploration phase. I have been unable to find its exact match in the literature so far and am excited that this algorithm may be marginally novel.

The algorithm was an online breadth-first search based planner that dynamically replanned whenever a new wall was seen and added to the representation.

### Approach to Minimize Time
The performance was timed in two phases: exploratory phase and final run. We began the exploration phase at a slower speed. Once it reached the center square, we incremented the speed by 0.03 m/s. Thereafter, each time it finished a final run, the speed was incremented. Expectedly, it reached a very high speed at some point where it slipped and collided against the wall. The algorithm gracefully shut down at that point. Since the best of final run times was taken, we were able to minimize it greatly!

### Takeaways
I had a blast while working out these algorithms and implementing them. I owe additional thanks to the course CS218M [Design & Analysis of Algorithms]. I feel this course has fundamentally changed the way I think about problems.
