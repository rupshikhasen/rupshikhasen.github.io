Welcome! I am Siddharth Saha. I graduated from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2021 fulfilling the requirements for Bacherlor's in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/) with Honors and with Minor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/)

During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to work under the guidance of wonderful mentors. I worked with [Prof. Leena Vachhani](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~leena/) on my Undergraduate Thesis and [Prof. Prasanna Gandhi](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/~gandhi/) on another research project related to modeling ultra-flexible inverted pendulum

At the institute, I was the founding member of a fully-funded technical team building a quadruped robot and motivated to solve the international urban search and rescue challenge [RoboCup Rescue League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/10)

This website is a quick outlet for my [thoughts and life updates](blog)

You can also read more about my [professional experience](work) & [key projects](project)



## Research Interests
<!-- My research interests lie at the intersection of exploration, optimization, trajectory planning, and SLAM. -->

- **Robot "interacting" with the environment** -- Manipulation to find a lost object in a pile of debris or environment exploration. The robot should not just passively learn about the environment, but interact with it to learn more. Some questions that bother me: 
    + How does the robot decide what to do next? 
    + What if there's an adversary it needs to be careful about? 
    + How does the robot take care of uncertainty? 
    + What if there's a dynamic object? 
    + How does the robot interact with the dynamic object to ascertain friend or foe?
- **Legged locomotion** -- Some questions that bother me: 
    + Do there exist gait patterns that are more energy efficient than wheeled robots? [Current research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332374021_Leg_Trajectory_Planning_for_Quadruped_Robots_with_High-Speed_Trot_Gait)
    + How does the control generalize over complex foothold constraints, like with steep stairs, slippery terrain, sharp rocks, rubble? 
    + Can we design perception/sensing algorithms to infer foothold constraints from the world in real time?
    + When a biped has lost balance and is about to fall, can it reflexively extend its arms to brace for impact, or reflexively grip a rigid object to prevent the fall?
- **Optimization** -- Both theoretically and as application to the above problems
