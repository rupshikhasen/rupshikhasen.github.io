Welcome! I am Siddharth Saha. I graduated from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2021, attaining a Bachelor's (with Honors) in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/) and a Minor degree in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/)

During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to work under the guidance of wonderful mentors. I worked with [Prof. Leena Vachhani](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~leena/) on my Undergraduate Thesis and [Prof. Prasanna Gandhi](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/~gandhi/) on another research project related to modeling ultra-flexible inverted pendulum

At the institute, I was the founding member of a fully-funded technical team building a quadruped robot and motivated to solve the international urban search and rescue challenge [RoboCup Rescue League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/10)

This website is a quick outlet for my [thoughts and life updates](blog)

You can also read more about my [professional experience](work) & [key projects](project)



## Research Interests
<!-- My research interests lie at the intersection of exploration, optimization, trajectory planning, and SLAM. -->

- **Task planning and Exploration via "active interaction" with the environment** -- Two types of problems:
    + Non-exploratory, well-defined task (like filling a cup from a tap after fetching it from a shelf across the kitchen)
    + Exploratory, abstract task (like searching for lost keys inside a house. The mobile robot may have to open a drawer, search underneath a heap of clothes, twist the door knob to search another room, etc.). In this problem, the robot does not just passively learn about the environment, but interacts with it to learn more.  
    Some questions that I find fascinating: 
        * How can decision making algorithms be designed to solve such task planning problems?
        * How to sync the mobility of arms with that of the robot base?
        * How does the robot take care of uncertainty? 
        * What if there's a dynamic object?
- **Legged locomotion** -- Some questions that bother me: 
    + Do there exist gait patterns that are more energy efficient than wheeled robots? [Current research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332374021_Leg_Trajectory_Planning_for_Quadruped_Robots_with_High-Speed_Trot_Gait)
    + How does the control generalize over complex foothold constraints, like with steep stairs, slippery terrain, sharp rocks, rubble? 
    + Can we design perception/sensing algorithms to infer foothold constraints from the world in real time?
    + When a biped has lost balance and is about to fall, can it reflexively extend its arms to brace for impact, or reflexively grip a rigid object to prevent the fall?
- **Optimization** -- Both theoretically and as application to the above problems
    + Trajectory optimization
    + Pose graph optimization
