### Terminologies
#### MESPP
In Multi-robot Efficient Search Path Planning (MESPP), a team of robots is tasked with capturing a moving target within a given deadline. In this paper, we assume that the target is non-adversial. This simply means that the target doesn't try to foil the capture team's plans and sticks to its pre-defined course of actions.

#### NP-Hard
NP-Hard problems are a class of problems, for which no polynomial-time algorithms are known to exist as yet. An NP-Hard problem can be reduced to any other problem in the NP-Hard class of problems in polynomial time. Once the given problem is proven to be NP-Hard, we can convert it to more familiar versions of NP-Hard problems for which (non-polynomial time) algorithms are known.

#### MILP
Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is an optimization problem where only some variables are constrained to be integers, while other variables can be non-integers. It deals with linear objective function subjected to linear constraints.

#### False Negatives

#### Arbitrary Capture Ranges
