# Laser scan visualization
```
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup rviz2.launch.py
```


# Waypoint Navigation

### Part 1: Map-building
```
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
ros2 launch turtlebot3_cartographer cartographer.launch.py use_sim_time:=True
ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard (Move the bot around so that entire world is explored)
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/map
```

### Part 2: Waypoint Follower
```
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py use_sim_time:=True map:=$HOME/map.yaml (Set initial pose estimate near bot's current location)
ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard (Move bot around a little to improve the AMCL cloud confidence)
Rviz2: Switch to "Waypoint mode", add three "Navigation2 Goal"'s and "Start Navigation" (illustrated in accompanying video)
```
