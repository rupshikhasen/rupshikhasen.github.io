My name featured on [today's Economic Times]({{ '/assets/pdf/Economic_Times_06_Jan_2021.pdf' | absolute_url }}) (*on page 7, dated 06 Jan 2021*) for winning the Economic Times Campus Stars \'20 Award from over 49,000 candidates across India.

It's a small area on the newspaper, but I am delighted and inspired nonetheless.
